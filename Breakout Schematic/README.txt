The MAX5318 in TSSOP24-package is soldered on a TSSOP28 breakout board 
available on ebay. This is also why the outputs of the MAX5318 schematic symbol
seem shifted from the pinout on the datasheet. This is true!

The "shift" in pins is caused by the 28 pin breakout board.
Pin 12 of the MAX5318 is pin 12 in the schematic
pin 13 of the MAX5318 is pin 17 in the schematic
the rest is the same ... 

The breakout boards will be available in about a month!
