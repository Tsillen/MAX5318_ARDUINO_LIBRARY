http://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/data-converters/digital-to-analog-converters/MAX5318.html

The MAX5318 is a high-accuracy, 18-bit, serial SPI input, buffered voltage output digital-to-analog converter (DAC) in a 4.4mm x 7.8mm, 24-lead TSSOP package. The device features ±2 LSB INL (max) accuracy and a ±1 LSB DNL (max) accuracy over the full temperature range of -40°C to +105°C.

The DAC voltage output is buffered resulting in a fast settling time of 3µs and a low offset and gain drift of ±0.5ppm/°C of FSR (typ). The force-sense output (OUT) maintains accuracy while driving loads with long lead lengths. Additionally, a separate AVSS supply, allows the output amplifier to go to 0V (GND) while maintaining full linearity performance.

The MAX5318 includes user-programmable digital gain and offset correction to enable easy system calibration.

At power-up, the device resets its outputs to zero or midscale. The wide 2.7V to 5.5V supply voltage range and integrated low-drift, low-noise reference buffer amplifier make for ease of use.

The MAX5318 features a 50MHz, 3-wire, SPI interface. The MAX5318 is available in a 24-lead TSSOP package and operates over the -40°C to +105°C temperature range.
